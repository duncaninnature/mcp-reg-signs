# Martial Cottle Park regulatory sign status
This is an interactive web map detailing real-time condition of regulatory signs covering bike trails, parking lots, and roadways inside the park. Data collection began in March, 2024, strictly covering bike paths. Parking lot and roadway signs were added later in 2024. Martial Cottle Park staff cleaned or replaced some signs per PDF map files sent by the map author.

In January, 2025, the map author updated the data to reflect any completed maintenance and new sign statuses. An interactive web map was published January 9, 2025 to track changes in real time, and simplify the process for identifying changes that need to be made. If the map contains any errors or needs to be updated, contact Duncan Keller at duncaninnature@gmail.com
